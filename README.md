Penetration Testing Notes
==========================

These are notes and instructions I've been writing up for performing penetration testing.

### Part 1: Building a security lab
- **Building a virtual router** - We need to build two networks, one for our targets and one for our attacking hosts and put
a router in between them.
- **Firewall rules** - By changing the iptables rules, we can simulate more realistic environments.
- **List of hosts** - A list of the hosts and their descriptions.

### Part 2: Network reconnaissance

### Part 3: Exploitation - Direct

### Part 4: Exploitation - Indirect
