to register and download it.  It's also available from SourceForge without registering.  There are some Metasploitable hosts on the
lab network.

#### Debian
[Debian.org](http://debian.org)

The Linux distribution used for most of the supporting architecture of the lab.  Debian is known for its stability; it keeps things clean
and uncluttered as far as Linux distributions go.

#### CentOS
[CentOS.org](https://centos.org/)

A free version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is popular in corporate and enterprise environments.  Some of the target hosts in the lab
are running this, as it provides a good simulation of real networks.
