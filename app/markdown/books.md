Books

There are a lot of information security books out there.  Some of them good, some of them not so good.  Here are the books
on my personal bookshelf.

## General Security

#### Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd ed
*Jon Erickson, No Starch Press*

This has become one of the most well known introductions to information security from a practical perspective.

#### Counter Hack Reloaded, 2nd ed
*Ed Skoudis with Tom Liston, Prentice Hall*

I find this to be a little dated, but still very good.

#### Fundamentals of Secure Computer Systems
*Brett C. Tjaden, Franklin, Beedle & Associates*

The author was actually a former professor of mine when I was studying computer science.

## Malware Analysis

## Forensics and Rerverse Engineering


## Operating Systems

#### How Linux Works
*Brian Ward, No Starch Press*

A very good book for those who know the basics of UNIX-like operating systems but want to know the nerdy details of how Linux is put
together.

#### Linux Kernel Development, 3rd ed
*Robert Love, Addison Wesley*

If you want to understand Linux at a deep level, then this is a good guide.

#### Operating System Design and Implementation, 3rd ed
*Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Albert S. Woodhull, Prentice Hall*

I'm going to admit that I haven't actually read this one.  It makes it on the list because it's probably the only book available that 
deconstructs a modern operating system as the author sees it.


## Software Development

#### Grey Hat Python
*Justin Seitz, No Starch Press*

A book on how to use Python in security research.  I bought this out of curiosity and I quickly learned a ton about some of the cooler
aspects of Python and how it can interact with code and data at a low level.
